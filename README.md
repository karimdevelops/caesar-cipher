![Caesar Cipher preview](img/preview.png)
<br><br><br><br>
A crpytography program based on the method of ancient romans called <strong>caesar cipher</strong>.
There are many cryptography programs available on the internet, however, this program is relatively different <i>and of course</i> great.

Here's why:
<ul>
<li>The alogarithm used is easy to understand.</li>
<li>It is user-friendly and offers modern UI.</li>
<li>It is a fun program for many beginners who are not only interested in GUIs but also crpytography.</li>
</ul>

:warning: <i><strong>NOTE: This project is mainly focused on creating an "easy to understand" crpytography program. Messages encrpyted by caesar cipher can be easily decrypted using a brute-force attack. Therefore, it is not recommended to use this for anything important (or serious). Use at your own risk!</i></strong>
